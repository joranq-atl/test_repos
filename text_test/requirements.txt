# --- Environment & Tools ---
# If you need to install specific Python versions (less common here)
# python-dateutil

# Define a dependency needed only for development/testing
# This often requires separate files like requirements-dev.txt
# But can be listed here if the environment is a monolithic "dev" one.

# --- Optional Dependencies (Good for illustrating file structure) ---
# If you have extras, you can specify them like this:
